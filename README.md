# DianaFramework

**DianaFramework** is a Java-based MVC/MVP framework that I independently developed between 2006 and 2007, during a time when enterprise Java applications were heavily reliant on tools like Ant, XDoclet, and early Spring. It was designed to support modular, GUI-based systems using Swing and JPA/Hibernate.

## ✨ Purpose

This code reflects a phase of my career where I was solving complex problems with the tools available at the time. I’m sharing it now not as a product to be used, but as an **invitation to curiosity** — particularly for younger developers working with modern Spring Boot who want to see how we used to build frameworks from scratch.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Java 5/6
- Spring Framework (pre-Boot)
- JPA / Hibernate
- Java Swing (GUI)
- XDoclet
- Ant
- Subversion (now Git)

## 📜 Background

This framework was part of a personal and professional effort to improve how public-sector Java systems were built. It was proposed to CAEd/UFJF and influenced the design direction of internal systems like **SisLAME**. I wrote and maintained this code independently and submitted it as a framework proposal.

- 📄 **NOTE**: See a Proof of Concept prepared for CAEd/UFJF at [ExemploCAEdDianaFramework](https://github.com/aryrfjr/ExemploCAEdDianaFramework).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository contains source code that I **independently authored** outside the scope of my contract with CAEd/UFJF. It does **not** include any proprietary or confidential work from CAEd, and is shared strictly for educational and historical purposes.

## 🧭 Why Share This Now?

I'm currently open to new opportunities as a Java Developer. With 20+ years of experience, I remain an active learner and builder. Sharing this code is one way to demonstrate how I think, how I build, and how I reflect.

> 👋 If you're an interviewer or fellow developer, I invite you to explore this with curiosity — and ask me anything you'd like to know about how it worked, and how I think today.
